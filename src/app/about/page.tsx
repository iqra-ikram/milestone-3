        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Hello! I'm Iqra Ikram, a passionate Frontend Developer with a deep love for building interactive and visually appealing web applications. I am currently a student at GIAIC, where I am exploring AgenticAI and GenAI. I am in my first year of study.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a developer, I am constantly driven by the desire to learn new technologies and improve my skills. My journey in web development began with learning the core technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, TypeScript, and I have since expanded my knowledge to modern frameworks and libraries like React.js, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
